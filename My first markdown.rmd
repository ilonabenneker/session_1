```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
This is my first markdown file.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
Download sleep study data
```{r}
library(readr)
sleep <- read_csv(
    "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/lme4/sleepstudy.csv")
head(sleep)
```
Plot the data by subject
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(sleep, aes(x = Days, y = Reaction)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 8, by = 2)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Subject)
```

Summary statistics by subject

```{r}
library(dplyr)
sleep %>%
  group_by(Subject) %>%
  summarise(mean(Reaction))
```

Mean-center reaction times and plot on a single axis

```{r}
sleep %>%
  group_by(Subject) %>%
  mutate(mean_centered_reaction = Reaction - mean(Reaction)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Days, y = mean_centered_reaction,
      colour = factor(Subject))) + 
    geom_smooth(show.legend = FALSE, se = FALSE) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 8, by = 2))
